# Acknowledgments

I first want to thank all the PolySat faculty and students that came before me and layed the groundwork for this research, specifically Dr. Jordi Puig-Suari, Ryan Sellers, and Arash Mehrparvar.

I absolutely must thank Dr. John Bellardo for lending me his infinite wisdom not just in this project, but throughout my undergraduate career.

Dr. Matt Moelter, thank you dearly for your mentorship over these last two quarters.

Thanks to all the wonderful student engineers I've worked with at PolySat over the last four years. Special thanks to Liam Bruno for leading my feeble physics brain through the treacherous landscape of spacecraft controls.

Thanks to my girlfriend, Mari Friedman, and to anyone else who has supported me through this project and through my time at Cal Poly.

And finally, thanks to my parents, Helene and Louis Bouchard, who are ultimately responsible for the existence of this project. Thanks for your endless support.
